- The  -table- element is used to add tables to a web page.
    - A table is drawn out row by row. Each row is created with the -tr- element.
        - Inside each row there are a number of cells represented by the -td- element (or -th- if it is a header).
            - You can make cells of a table span more than one row or column using the rowspan and colspan attributes. For long tables you can split the table into a  -thead-, -tbody-, and -tfoot-.
